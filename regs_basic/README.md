# Basic Registers example

The control registers have 32-bit values that can be changed through the MCC instrument screen on the Moku application. Here we interpret 16 bits of each of the first two control registers as a (signed) DC voltage to output from the MCC instrument. For example, if the MiM configuration routes the MCC slot outputs to the DACs, this is a simple programmable DC supply.
